![](res/readme/intelligent_header.png?raw=true)

Upload files or folders (even with subfolders) to Amazon S3 in a totally automatized way taking advantage of:

- **Amazon S3 Multipart Upload**: The uploaded files are processed transparently in [parts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) improving the throughput and the quick recovery from any network issues.

- **Resilent Retry System**: Intelligent S3 Upload has been built to detect any error during the uploading process and to perform any retries whenever is necessary. 

- **User Friendly Interface**: Just check the demo to see with your own eyes how the upload process is performed.

    "storage_class": "",
    "skip_s3_existing_files": true
}
```

- **aws_access_key_id | aws_secret_access_key**: Credentials generated by [Amazon IAM](https://www.cloudberrylab.com/resources/blog/how-to-find-your-aws-access-key-id-and-secret-access-key/#how-to-retrieve-iam-access-keys).
